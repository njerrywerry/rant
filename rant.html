		<h2>What I Dont Like: Smalltalk</h2>

		<p>So, i know people will be wondering, <em>"What's wrong with this girl, who doesn't like smalltalk?"</em> Well, I don't. Not because I don't like talking to people, but because I just can't sit down and talk about the weather. I mean, really, <i>the weather?</i> </p>
		<p>Another form of smalltalk I really don't like; <em>"What's the meaning of your tattoo?"</em> I know this may sound harsh, but I find that question to be really trivial. Because even after I tell you, <em><strong>what will you do with that information??</strong></em> I mean, if you won't ask any follow up questions, like, <em>"what made you get that tattoo, why that specific pattern,"</em> stuff like that, I don't see why you should ask. Let me give an example on this so you do not think I'm being rude.</p>
		<p>The other day, I was in a matatu going home; I was pretty tired, having had to haul my heavy laptop around town. So just as i was about to alight, this dude comes and sits next to me. Then he goes, <em>"Sasa msupa,"</em>. And in my head I'm thinking, 'do people still use that term????'. Anyway, I just said hey back, out of courtesy. Then he asks, <em>"Have you seen me around before?"</em> Im like, no. Then he goes, <em>"Your tattoo is really nice, what does it mean?"</em>....................................</p>
		<p>I mean, really, who would't be annoyed by this? Just picture it in your mind, ladies and gentlemen; you are tired, drained, then this person, <strong>whom you do not know</strong>, comes and blocks your way, and starts asking about your tattoo. Not that he actually cared what it means. This was just smalltalk to get me to give him my number.</p>
		<p>So in short, ask me if I think aliens exist, ask me if I have figured out my purpose on this earth, ask me my views on death, ask me if I think Mars is habitable. Just please dont ask me about the weather.</p>
